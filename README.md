# Opilot Labs Technology Radar

## Overview

Welcome to the Opilot Labs Technology Radar! This document outlines the technologies we are currently evaluating, trialing, adopting, or holding off on, as we strive to deliver innovative, secure, and efficient solutions. Our radar is divided into four main quadrants: Techniques, Tools, Platforms, and Languages & Frameworks. Each quadrant is further divided into rings that indicate the stage of adoption: Adopt, Trial, Assess, and Hold.

## Quadrants and Rings

### Techniques

Technologies and methodologies that improve our processes and development practices.

### Tools

Software tools that assist in development, testing, deployment, and monitoring of applications.

### Platforms

Infrastructure and platforms that support the deployment and operation of our applications.

### Languages & Frameworks

Programming languages and frameworks that we use to build our applications.

### Rings

- **Adopt**: Technologies that we have fully adopted and recommend for use.
- **Trial**: Technologies that we are currently experimenting with and evaluating for future adoption.
- **Assess**: Technologies that we are exploring but have not yet started trialing.
- **Hold**: Technologies that we are not currently considering due to various concerns such as privacy, security, or maturity.
